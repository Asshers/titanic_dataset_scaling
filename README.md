**Title:** Titanic Dataset Preprocessing and Outlier Removal

**Description:** 

Welcome to the Titanic Dataset Preprocessing and Outlier Removal repository! In this project, we perform essential data preprocessing and cleaning tasks on the famous Titanic dataset. The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their survival status, age, gender, ticket class, and more.

**Key Steps in this Repository:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** We conduct basic data preprocessing to ensure the data is in a suitable format for analysis. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical representation, and dealing with data inconsistencies.

2. **Outlier Detection and Removal:** Outliers, which are extreme values that can adversely affect analysis or modeling, are identified and removed from the dataset. We use appropriate techniques to detect and handle these outliers.

3. **Feature Scaling:** To ensure fair comparisons and efficient model training, we apply Min-Max scaling to the feature set, bringing all features within a specific range.

**Why Preprocessing Matters:** 

Data preprocessing is a critical step in any data analysis or machine learning project. By cleaning the data and removing outliers, we can ensure more accurate and reliable results from our analyses and models. Proper preprocessing can enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms, leading to more informed decision-making.
